This is just a game I created in Python one day, but then switched over to Java because I wanted to make this into an Android app. I never really got that far yet.


So here's the gist of the game, you have to defeat a single enemy. However, the enemy has all the skills you have, so you have to be careful and act smart.


So here are the attacks you and the enemy know along with how much damage they deal:

Poke, 10 damage

Kick, 20 damage

Chomp, 30 damage

Strike, 40 damage

Punch, 60 damage

Smack, 70 damage

Slap, 80 damage

Jab, 90 damage

Explode, 100 damage


Word to the wise, Explode deals you 100 damage as well, so use it wisely.


Both you and the enemy also have a method of healing. Put simply, the skill Heal recovers 50 Health. That should help a bit.


In conclusion, this game is case-sensitive, so type carefully. Have fun!
